This project contains a simple rdf file (in .n3 notation) and a few sparql queries that can be run on them.

The project has been designed to demonstrate encoding of simple scene graphs (spatial relations) in rdf, and querying on them.

The queries are tested on the generic sparql endpoint SPARQLer (http://sparql.org/sparql.html)
